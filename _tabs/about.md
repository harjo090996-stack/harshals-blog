I’m Harshal Joshi, a lifelong learner with a strong interest in understanding finance, businesses, markets, and systems from first principles.

Over time, my curiosity has expanded beyond textbooks and models into building a deeper, long-term understanding of how industries evolve, how capital is allocated, and how technology reshapes markets.

My primary interests lie at the intersection of Banking & Financial Services, Technology, Clean Energy, and Consumer businesses. I enjoy breaking down complex topics—whether it’s a bank’s balance sheet, a business model, or a macro trend—into simple, intuitive ideas. Reading and connecting ideas across domains are central to how I learn.

This website is a personal knowledge base and portfolio. 

It’s where I document:

🚀 Deep dives into finance, public markets and business concepts

🚀 Notes and insights from books and podcasts

🚀 Explorations across technology, energy, and life beyond work

I believe good thinking compounds. By writing regularly and revisiting ideas, I aim to sharpen my understanding and share perspectives that are clear, honest, and grounded in fundamentals.

When I’m not reading or writing, you’ll usually find me exploring new topics, traveling, or staying active—cycling & playing tennis.
